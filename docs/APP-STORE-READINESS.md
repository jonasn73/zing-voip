# App Store & Google Play Readiness

Checklist to get Zing approved on the **Apple App Store** and **Google Play**. Use this before submitting.

## Must-have (blocking)

### 1. Privacy policy URL
- **Required by both stores.** You must provide a live, public URL in App Store Connect and Play Console.
- **In-app:** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL` (web) and `EXPO_PUBLIC_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL` (mobile). The Settings screen shows a “Security & Privacy” / “Privacy Policy” link that opens this URL when set.
- **Content:** Describe what data you collect (email, name, phone, business name, call logs, recordings), how you use it, and how users can request deletion. Mention Twilio and your hosting (e.g. Vercel, Neon).

### 2. App icon and splash (mobile)
- **Location:** `mobile/assets/` (see `mobile/assets/README.md` for sizes).
- **Required files:**
  - `icon.png` – 1024×1024 px (App Store), Expo will generate other sizes
  - `splash-icon.png` – e.g. 1284×2778 px or use Expo’s splash specs
  - `adaptive-icon.png` – 1024×1024 px (Android foreground)
- **If missing:** EAS/Expo builds can fail or use defaults. Add these before submitting.
- See: [Expo icons](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/splash-screen-and-app-icon/), [adaptive icon](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/user-interface/splash-screen-and-app-icon/#adaptive-icon).

### 3. 401 → login (mobile)
- When the session expires or is invalid, API calls return **401**. The app **redirects to the login screen** instead of only showing “Failed to load.”
- **Implemented:** Tab screens (Routing, Activity, Contacts, Pay) check for `error.status === 401` and call `router.replace("/login")`.

### 4. Error boundary (mobile)
- An uncaught JavaScript error in any screen can crash the app. A **React Error Boundary** catches render errors and shows a “Something went wrong” screen with a “Try again” button.
- **Implemented:** `mobile/app/_layout.tsx` exports `ErrorBoundary` (Expo Router uses it to wrap the layout).

### 5. No dead ends
- **Forgot password:** Either implement a “Forgot password?” flow or remove the link so it’s not a dead end.
- **Support/Contact:** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_URL` (web) and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_URL` (mobile). Settings shows “Help & Support” that opens this URL when set. Both stores expect users to be able to contact you.

## Recommended (design & quality)

### 6. Safe area (mobile)
- Use `SafeAreaView` or `useSafeAreaInsets()` so content doesn’t sit under the notch or home indicator. Especially on login, signup, onboarding, and tab screens.

### 7. Accessibility (mobile)
- Add `accessibilityLabel` (and where useful `accessibilityRole` / `accessibilityHint`) for:
  - All buttons and links
  - Form inputs (email, password, phone, etc.)
  - Tab bar items
  - Main headings/sections
- Improves App Store review and usability for VoiceOver/TalkBack users.

### 8. Web error pages
- Add `app/error.tsx` and `app/not-found.tsx` so the web app shows a proper error/404 page instead of a blank or default error.

### 9. Touch targets (web + mobile)
- Buttons and tappable elements should be at least **44×44 pt** (Apple HIG). Check nav items, form buttons, and list rows.

### 10. Terms of use
- Optional but recommended: a Terms of Use URL (linked from signup or Settings). Some regions or use cases require it.
